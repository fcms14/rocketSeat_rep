# 💻 About the challenge
Let's put into practice everything that was seen in this third phase! 😍 The idea now is to create Space Cream in the Desktop version! 🚀

You will receive a **[link](https://www.figma.com/file/pddZCuQIRLjk5dEHQ4L4YR/Stage-03---Grid-com-anima%C3%A7%C3%B5es/duplicate)** with the layout, as you can see below:

Pay attention to the content that was taught in class. So, in this challenge, remember to use:

- Grid;
- Animations and transitions, as seen in class;
- Medium queries.

**Note:** You can use the previous challenge as a base. No need to create a new file for this challenge. beauty? As you can see, the Desktop version has a footer and the mobile version doesn't. And there? How can we control this, huh? 👀 Are you ready to face this challenge? **💜**

Remembering: try to challenge yourself, but if you have any difficulties, you can go to our **[fórum](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/h/forum/explorer)** and leave your question there!

Good luck and leeeeeeets code! **🚀**
